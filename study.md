## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
    Wireframe is in a notebook. Hoping for it to be very simple.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
    The tic tac toe board will be saved as a cell, with an array of 9 values
    of Xs and Os.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    Empty divs with the ability of response to user commands. Also my
    welcome's sign in and log out.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
    I want to refresh the lessons starting from JS. Then, start with my html
    but my css will be definetely the last thing to be approached. JS will be
    the most challenging for me.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    User to want a "log in" and "sign up" buttons.
    User to want an "alarm" or reminder sound to go back to the game and make
    the next move.
    User to want a "save game" option to look back at those matches.
    User to want a "re-match" and "??? WINS!" buttons.
    User to want to be identified as "Player A" or "Player B".

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    By keeping my css, html, JS separate. Plus triple-checking on console! And
    most importantly, study on my own and asking questions.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
    I was thinking about using emojis to make it fun for 12-years olds. But
    that is a bonus so I might change this plan :)

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
    Through github's repository. Making sure I have frequent commits with
    good and concise and useful messages.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
    I do not think so! I feel a little overwhelmed.
